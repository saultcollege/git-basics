# Conclusion

Congratulations!  You now know enough about the workings of Git to be productive with it in a distributed environment.  You can track and compare changes in a set of files, you can manage multiple branches of changes to help you organize related changes and keep unrelated or potentially risky changes separate.  You can collaborate and synchronize your repository with other people using remotes and the pull and push commands.  You understand some useful workflows that can simplify collaboration.  And you can use online Git hosts to share your repositories with others over the internet.

There is much more that is possible with Git, and the Git documentation is a good resource if you wish to dig deeper, not to mention the many other online tutorials and blog posts.  A few helpful links in this vein have been provided in the next section.

Enjoy the power and peace of mind you now have to make changes to your software projets with abandon!
