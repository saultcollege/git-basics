# Distributed VCS Basics

Git is a distributed version control system, meaning that you may have many copies of a repository and Git will help you keep all the copies in sync.  Having just learned about branches in Git you might wonder why you would want multiple copies of a repository.  Why not just use one repository with multiple branches?

The reason is that often you will be working with a team of people, and each individual will need a copy of the repository on their computer.  Another common need is to be able to work on a repository from multiple devices, perhaps a work computer and a personal computer at homeâ€”each device can have a copy of the repository.  

Git will help you make sure that changes made in one copy get applied correctly in other copies.
