# You Know the Basics!

Congratulations!  You now have enough knowledge of Git concepts and commands to use it in your own projects to keep track of change history in a set of text files.  

Most Git repositories involve software files, but you are by no means limited to that.  As one example, Johns Hopkins University used a Git repository to maintain [a record of Covid-19 cases](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) worldwide during the coronavirus pandemic.

In the next section of this tutorial you will learn how to use the distributed features of Git so that you can access and work on your Git repositories on any device with Git installed.
