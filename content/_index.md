# Git Basics

## Introduction

This web site is an introduction to the Git version control system.  After working through the content of this web site you should be able to use Git comfortably for your own projects.

There is much more that can be done with most of Git commands you encounter in this tutorial.  The [Git Reference Manual](https://git-scm.com/docs) has all the details you need for any command.  The [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/docs) is also a great resource for gaining a deeper understanding of Git's features and functionality.

## Assumptions

This tutorial is meant for complete beginners.  The only assumption is that you are comfortable entering commands and file paths into a command line shell.  See the [Command Line Shell Basics](https://saultcollege.github.io/shell-basics/) tutorial if you need help with that.
