# Git Basics

## Introduction

This web site is an introduction to the Git version control system.  After working through the content of this web site you should be able to use Git comfortably for your own projects.

There is much more to know about Git than what is covered here, though, and the official [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a good resource for obtaining a deeper understanding.

## Part 1 — Just the Basics

In this part you will learn the basic concepts and usage of Git for keeping track of changes in files and synchronizing those changes with a remote storage tool such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

## Part 2 — Beyond the Basics

In this part you will learn more advanced commands and usage patterns that will help you use Git to organize your programming efforts and collaborate in a team environment.
